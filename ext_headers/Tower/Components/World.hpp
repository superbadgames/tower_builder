/*
This is THE MAP of the Tower Engine. Every single map that is ever played will be run through this.

The map is the scene. It holds the hierarchy of nodes making up all the Entities that are rendering.

The map saves and loads the game by reading and dumping Entities into and out of database.

The database is powered by sqlite3.
