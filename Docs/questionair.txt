1
What is the game that you have been thinking about creating that inspired you to read this book?

Project Lateralus.

What objective would you like to meet by launching your indie game?

I want to finish a game. I have tried and failed many times to actually finish it, but this time, I don't want anything to stop me. I want to finish this game.


2
What makes you passionate about this game?

I want to express myself, with the chance of being able to start a company that could earn me some money.

In what game genre or category will reviewers classify it?

Single Player, Open world, turn base, real time RPG.


When did you first become interested in the play style, genre, category or theme that lies at the core of the game you want to create?

I think I've been intrested in RPG's for as long as they have existed. I can't remember not wanting to make an RPG. Specifically, Aidyn Chronicles was one of the first games that I ever played like this, and in a lot of ways, this game is an attempt to marry Aidyn Chronicles and World of Warcraft.


What was the first game you played in this genre that made you love the category?

World of Warcraft is a big one, but there are many others. Zelda. Aydin Chronicles. Gauntlet. It's like my whole life has lead to this.

3
What is the first platform on which you plan to release your game?

Windows PC.


What other platforms do you intend to support simultaneously, or soon after your initial launch?

Switch would be a big first one. Xbox and Playstation would be a plus. I will try to put this on every platform that I can.


Will your game require any additional hardware or peripherals for users to play, like VR headsets or alternative interface devices?

No.


4
In what programming language (or languages) will your game be coded?

c++ and maybe some python or lua.


Will you use a third party engine as the foundation for your game, or create it entirely from scratch?

Tower will be used to make this. It is a first party game engine.


If you’re using an engine, will it be Unity 2D or 3D? The Unreal Engine?  CryEngine? GameMaker? Something else?

Tower.

5
Is this your first game of this scale?

Yes.


Have you pursued lots of indie games in your life?

Yes, but maybe not with success.


Have you worked on other initiatives or startups that were similar in size to this project?

No and yes. Not a game, but many of the products at work are this big.

6
Dreams change as we live our lives. What is a game you once really hoped to create, but that is no longer as important to you?

I don't think I've given up completely on any ideas really... It's more like I haven't really committed to any of them. There are lots of projects that I have moved on from, but mostly this was because I felt like I would never finish them, or because I was trying to kick start myself, or because I only started them because I wanted to make this project, and then decided that it was beyond me. I don't know for sure. It's hard to say.


7
What game do you think you may want to build as few years from now that isn’t as important to you today?


The space sim game, Project Void is very exciting I think. Combined with some of the ideas of Project Sundress, and I think it could be a really cool game. That is not to mention the Klave story line... there is a lot. This project is the one that I was avoiding when I made Bones.


Why will you care more about it in a few years than you do now?

Yes, I hope so. I hope that as I finish more and more of this game, as I make more and more progress, I hope that I care about it more too. This is my primary focus. I don't care about anything else that I am working on.


8
Do you have ideas for additional content or follow-up products that can be introduced if the first game is a success?

Yes, this game is going to be a saga. Each section of the game will be released in Episode fashion, with follow up series.

Specifically, the Merak cycle will constitute part 1, which will lead into the Avarin cycle, which is part 2.


9
Is it the technology involved in the making of the game that interests you?

Yes! I really love making engines and I really want to know how it all works. I really want to make my own engine that will work for this game the way that I see it in my head. I want to prove to myself that I can do this!


Is it the genre or category of the game? The platform on which you’ll create the original version? The style of the interface? Or do you take joy in the visuals of the game? The audio? Some combination of the above choices?

It's the writing. The story telling. I want to make something that is in my head... I want to show it to people, but they can't see it until I make it real.

I am interested in everything! I want to tell this story, but its more than that. I want to build the engine myself. I want to do the art. My only lement is that I don't have more time to work on it. If I could work on it all the time, I would. If I could work on this and only this, not having to worry about money or rent or anything else, I would. This is what I want to do. This is where I would spent my time if I could. Well... I can! I have the skills, and I have the kind of job that will let me. I can't let that go. Nothing else is more important.


10
What makes you believe that this game will draw players attention in a crowded market?

I don't think this will draw player attention at all. But I can't worry about that. I can't be like Tolkien.


Is this a completely new idea, or are you setting out to improve on a game that already exists?

There are parts of it that are new. The way that I want to tell the story I have never seen done before, but its a known pattern for a game. The Pausing mechanic is going to be kind of interesting and new.

I would call this a new idea, now that I have thought about it a bit. Yeah, there are games that are kinda like it, but I've never played anything even remotely close to what I am working on.


11
If you could describe your indie game to a stranger in just one sentence that would interest him or her, what would that sentence be?

My game is an open world RPG with an epic story. The world is watching everything you say and everything you do, and will react accordingly.

I am going to have to work on this.

Lateralus is an open world rpg. The combat is pretty cool. You can toggle between real time and turn based in a unique way. The story is pretty epic too.


What are the three most important features that will make someone want to play your game and spend money on the title?

Epic Story line that carries on from game to game.
Unique combat system that blends real time and turn based.
It will have no Ludonarrative dissonance.


12
What is the primary mood of your game?

Heroic! You are heroes who are conquering the Abyss!

What is the pace of your game?

When in turn based mode, it wont be slow, but it will give you time to think. When in real time, you'll have to be on the edge of your seat.

How long will people play in a typical session, and where will they be playing?

Between 30 minutes and 2 hours.

One of the first people to play your game has lunch with a friend. What do they say to the friend about how they were feeling as they played it?

They should notice how interesting it is. There is a crazy story... that is honestly kind of hard to explain, but the combat is really cool. I haven't ever seen anything like it.

13
What will the first two minutes of the player experience be like in your game?

The player will create their character, which could take 2 minutes, I suppose, then they'll walk around their village doing chores before the Abyss comes up for the first time.

Will you have a tutorial? How will users learn how to play?

No.

14
What will the first playable prototype of your game include?

- Real time and turn based Combat toggle.
- Companion characters aka a party of 3 characters (you + 2).
- At least one Chthonic Fortress.
- The starting village of Merak.
- An open world area surrounding Merak's village. This will be a forest.
- NPCs to interact with, get quests from, turn quests in.
- A leveling system.
- Swords, Bows and Spells.
- Map, Quest Journal, Inventory
- Armor, clothing and weapons change and show up on the character models.
- Basic AI.

15
What kinds of people will want to play your game?

Fans of rpgs like d&d, wow, final fantasy, as well as fans of fantasy books.

What other games do those same people play? What websites do they visit?

wow, d&d, final fantasy, dragon age, skyrim, and every other game they can get their hands on. They would use discord, facebook, twitter and the like, probably far more than I do.

Where would you find them on social media sites?

Gaming groups, fan groups for various games and things. Comics, Marvel, Star Wars, all of these things would interest them.

16
What games are the most similar to your indie title?

Aidyn Chronicles + WoW is really the best description.

How is yours different? What makes yours better?

Mine is going to be a new IP, and it will focus on what the narrative has to say. You wont be able to get away with the kinds of things you do in wow. The abilities you use, when you use them, and how you act in the world will matter a lot. It wont be so much what your char score is, but what stupid things you decide to have come out your mouth!

17
How would you feel if The New York Times, Wired magazine, Oprah Winfrey and your best friend's mother all said your games sucks?

They are dicks.

18
You just won a mega-million-dollar jackpot in the lottery! You’ve cleared your to-do list and taken a 3 month vacation at a series of your favorite cities and resorts. You return happy, rested and all caught up in every phase of your life. There’s no to-do list for work, and nothing at home that needs to be cleaned, straightened, fixed, watered, painted, re-arranged or put away. You no longer need to work, nor does your spouse or partner. If you have kids, however, they still attend the same grade of school and they still have to do their homework. Some things can’t be changed by money! From this moment on you can do whatever you want to do each day. In this “perfect world’ how would you spend the first month when you got back?

I'd make my game. I'd start my company and just go to work, 9 to 5 for myself.

A magical genie has decided to reward you for all the good deeds you have done. You are transported back to your old home, the place where you lived when you were twelve years old. It is late in the night and everyone else is asleep. You are not alone in the room. Sitting across from you is your 12 year old self. Even though you are both the same person, the adult you and the 12 year old you can talk to each other in the same way that any two people can talk. The genie will allow you to tell your 12 year old self three things about your grown up life and see how “the younger you” reacts at age 12. Tomorrow morning, the 12 year old version of you will have no memory of this conversation. But, for tonight you can share three things that you would have most wanted to know back then about your future life. And you’ll get to see how you as a child would react to knowing these three facts. What three details about your life do you share? How does 12 year old you respond?
